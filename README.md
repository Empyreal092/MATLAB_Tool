# MATLAB_Tool
These are some tools for MATLAB that I use often. 
Specifically, if some MATLAB code I wrote prompts you that some scripts are missing, they are most likely here. 

I set up my MATLAB to have these tools available by default. 
To do this, I change the MATLAB [``userpath``](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/userpath.html) to the folder containing these files. 
This way on MATLAB startup these files will be in MATLAB's search path and [``startup.m``](https://github.com/Empyreal092/MATLAB_Tool/blob/main/startup.m) will run.

Additional to these files, I also have [matlab-schemer](https://github.com/Empyreal092/matlab-schemer) and [chebfun](https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun) in the folder.
